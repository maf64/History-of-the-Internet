<p style="color:white">As are the sign of the times, the internet in 2021 looks completely different than it did in 1995, but the concept and application of connecting computers from all over the world has remained consistent. <br> J.C.R. Licklider, a Psychology professor at MIT, is credited with the idea of connecting computers to transfer information; an idea that would evolve into the internet over the next half-century. <br> Over the course of several decades running concurrent with the Cold War, the United States Government hired experts to create a model of communications that would prevent foreign powers from intercepting transfer links between phone calls, <br> and this problem would find similar context with information transfer between computers. <br>At the same time, computers in the 1950s and 1960s were large, expensive and inaccessible to those outside of research and computer science, <br> so resources into building computer connections (such as with the phone companies) was limited.</p>
